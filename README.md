# Price-Checking-Tool
A simple price checking tool for path of exile. It checks your inventory for valuable Items and displays its price.

## Story
We often play in a group and just putting all loot into our stashtabs without looking at it. It often appears, that we delete or sell items to the vendor because we are lazy as fuck and dont want to check all of them on PoE-Trade or with specific macros.
What we wanted to have is a tool, which checks our dump-tabs on valuable items and lists them with their estimated price, so that we only have to identify all items and throw them onto the stash.
